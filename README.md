## Introduction
A proof-of-concept devirtualization engine for Themida, written as part of my Master's Thesis.

The engine is written as a plugin for IDA 6.8, and only supports early versions of the FISH virtual machine architecture (2.2.5.0, 2.2.6.0, 2.2.7.0).

The source code is provided exclusively for educational purposes, and I take no responsibility for what you do with it.

My Master's Thesis is further included as a PDF, which you may read to better understand the subject and project.
